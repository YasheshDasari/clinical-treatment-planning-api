## Technology Stack

- NestJS
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- JWT Authentication
- Jest

## Documentation

- Software Requirements Specification → `docs/SoftwareRequirements.md`
- Architecture Design → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Software Requirements Specification
The `SoftwareRequirements.md` documentation defines:
- Functional Requirements (FR)
- Security Requirements (SEC)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

### Architecture Overview
The system follows a layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository, Database. External systems interact only through secured REST endpoints. <br>
The `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes the full architectural diagrams and module breakdown.
